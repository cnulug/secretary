#LUG meeting notes for 8-30-15

##Outline

* We had a brief discussion on Linux and its role in enterprise and business.
* We had members introduce themselves, the Linux distribution they are currently using, and the reason they are now running Linux or looking to learn it.
* We mentioned a few ideas for club events and had open discussion about general topics in technology.
* Jake Hayhurst helped Will Little install Ubuntu on his desktop.
* The club's IRC Channel was advertised, see below for instructions on how to connect to it.

##Connecting to the IRC

**If you wish to keep things simple and use the web client, simply go to the URL below, enter a nickname and click connect. [http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=cnulug](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=cnulug)**

###To connect without the web client:

*Before connecting to an IRC channel, you will need an IRC client:*

- [XChat](http://xchat.org) - A Linux client with a GUI
- [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io) - A Windows client with a GUI

- [irssi](http://irssi.org) - A Unix (Mac, Linux, BSD, etc.) client for the terminal
- [ircII](http://www.eterna.com.au/ircii) - A Unix (Mac, Linux, BSD, etc.) client for the terminal with DCC support

To join the channel, open your IRC client of choice, connect to the server irc.freenode.net
and join the channel #cnulug.

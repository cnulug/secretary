##Live install on a virtual machine
for the two new people to Linux we did a live install to a virtual machine on Nathan's computer.
This was a debian graphical install and we talked about how to install Linux as well as what the individual parts do and why they are important.

* Such as partitioning disks and the use of grub

##Free and open software discussion 
we discussed what free and open software means, the importance of free and open software to Linux, and even how to edit some of the software.

##Great impromptu discussion on editing software
When discussing the importance of free and open software one of the newer people to Linux asked about editing the software to customize it.
This started and impromptu discussion by Nathan about the editing of the kernel and some of the basic bash commands.

* echo - writing a message to the current display 
* cat - Concatenate and print (display) the content of files
* > - write to file
* >> - append to file
* grep - Search file(s) for lines that match a given pattern
* tr - translate takes 2 arguments and replaces the first with the later
* uniq â€“ Uniquify files (yes that is the technical term)
